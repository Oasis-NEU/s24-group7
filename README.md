**TU**NU**L** is a navigation project tailored for Northeastern University (NU or NEU) students, designed to ease their navigation within the campus tunnels.
Deployed at [tunul.netlify.app](https://tunul.netlify.app/)

## Description
Students at Northeastern University (NU or NEU) are often lost in the tunnels. The goal is to provide a navigation system that calculates the shortest path from a given source to a given destination, specific to the NU Boston Campus. The path will include detailed turn-by-turn instructions and time between each node, approximated with an average walking pace. Developed as part of the **TU**NU**L** project for the Oasis Project Series.

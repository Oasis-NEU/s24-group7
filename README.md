PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Students at Northeastern University (NU or NEU) are often lost in the tunnels. The goal is to provide a navigation system that calculates the shortest path from a given source to a given destination. The path will include detailed turn-by-turn instructions. Developed for the "tunul" project at Oasis, a club at NU. "tunul" began when I pitched the idea to club members.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open the folder using VS Code or an IDE of choice.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Dijkstra.cpp is intended for the back-end. For testing, enter the integer vertex that corresponds to the name of the location. Details are in the file.

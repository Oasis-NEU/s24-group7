This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API. [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Getting Started

First, install Node.js:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

Then, install Next.js for the project folder:

```bash
npm i next
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Students at Northeastern University (NU or NEU) are often lost in the tunnels. The goal is to provide a navigation system that calculates the shortest path from a given source to a given destination. The path will include detailed turn-by-turn instructions. Developed for the "tunul" project at Oasis, a club at NU. "tunul" began when I pitched the idea to club members.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Dijkstra.cpp is intended for the back-end. For testing, enter the integer vertex that corresponds to the name of the location. Details are in the file.
